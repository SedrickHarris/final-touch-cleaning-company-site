const faq = [
  {
    q: 'What does post-construction cleaning include after a Pulte home in Las Vegas?',
    a: `After a Pulte handoff, post-construction cleanup addresses the residue that builder cleaning does not remove: drywall dust on every surface including vents, HVAC returns, and cabinet interiors; adhesive and caulk residue around fixtures and tile; window film on all glass; construction debris from trim and baseboard work; and fine particulate that settles in corners and on sills. Scope is confirmed during a walkthrough before the clean begins.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Do Pulte and Del Webb homes in Las Vegas need post-construction cleaning before move-in?',
    a: `Yes. Pulte builds standard residential and Del Webb active adult communities throughout the Las Vegas Valley, and both types require post-construction cleanup before move-in. Builder cleaning prepares a home for the walkthrough, not for occupancy. Construction residue including drywall dust, adhesive, and window film is present in every new build regardless of the community type or price point.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'How long after a Pulte handoff should I schedule post-construction cleaning?',
    a: `Schedule as close to the handoff date as possible, before furnishings or personal items are moved in. An empty home is significantly easier to clean thoroughly. If your move-in date is firm, call ${SITE.phone.display} in advance so Final Touch can align the clean with your schedule. Most post-construction cleans on a new Pulte home are completed in a single visit.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Is the post-construction cleanup scope different for a Del Webb active adult home versus a standard Pulte home?',
    a: `The construction residue is the same regardless of community type: drywall dust, adhesive, window film, and fine grit are present in every new build. Del Webb homebuyers often plan long-term occupancy, which makes thorough cleanup before move-in especially worthwhile. The scope is confirmed during a walkthrough and reflects the specific home, not assumptions based on the community type.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'What Las Vegas Valley areas does Final Touch serve for Pulte post-construction cleaning?',
    a: `Final Touch serves post-construction cleanup across ${SITE.serviceArea.county}, Nevada, including Las Vegas, Henderson, and North Las Vegas. Pulte and Del Webb build throughout the Las Vegas Valley in communities across Summerlin, Henderson, and North Las Vegas. Call ${SITE.phone.display} to confirm coverage for your specific community and address.`,

            for Pulte homebuyers and project teams across Las Vegas, Henderson, and
            North Las Vegas. After a builder handoff, every surface holds construction
            residue that standard cleaning cannot address: drywall dust in vents and
            cabinet interiors, adhesive and caulk around fixtures, window film on every
            pane of glass, and fine particulate in every corner. We scope the clean
            against the actual site before quoting. The goal is a home that is
            genuinely ready to move into, not just visually checked.

              Most builders complete a cosmetic clean before the final walkthrough: surface
              wipe-downs, a vacuum pass on floors, and glass cleaned in common areas. This is
              standard practice across the industry and prepares the home for the walk without
              addressing construction residue at the detail level.
            </p>
            <p>
              What remains after a builder clean is consistent regardless of the builder&apos;s quality
              tier or community type. Drywall dust is ultrafine and airborne during construction; it
              settles into HVAC registers, inside cabinet interiors, on top of door frames, and on
              every horizontal surface. Adhesive and caulk residue collect around tile edges,
              fixtures, and trim. Window film is applied during construction to protect glass and
              must be removed before occupancy. Fine grit from cutting and sanding settles on floors
              and baseboards throughout the home.
            </p>
            <p>
              A professional post-construction clean addresses this layer of residue that a cosmetic
              builder clean is not intended to cover. The scope is confirmed on-site before the clean
              begins so nothing is assumed.
