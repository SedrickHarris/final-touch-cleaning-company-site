const faq = [
  {
    q: 'What does post-construction cleaning include after a Shea Homes build in Las Vegas?',
    a: `After a Shea Homes handoff, post-construction cleanup addresses the residue that builder cleaning does not remove: drywall dust on every surface including vents, HVAC returns, and cabinet interiors; adhesive and caulk residue around fixtures and tile; window film on all glass; construction debris from trim and baseboard work; and fine particulate that settles in corners and on sills. Scope is confirmed during a walkthrough before the clean begins.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Do Shea Active Lifestyle communities need post-construction cleaning before move-in?',
    a: `Yes. Shea Active Lifestyle communities are designed for buyers 55 and better who often plan long-term occupancy in a new home. The construction residue in an Active Lifestyle home is the same as any new build: drywall dust, adhesive, window film, and fine grit. Buyers planning to settle in for the long term benefit from a thorough clean that addresses every surface before furniture and belongings arrive.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'How long after a Shea Homes handoff should I schedule post-construction cleaning?',
    a: `Schedule as close to the handoff date as possible, before furnishings or personal items are moved in. An empty home is significantly easier to clean thoroughly. If your move-in date is firm, call ${SITE.phone.display} in advance so Final Touch can align the clean with your schedule. Most post-construction cleans on a new Shea home are completed in a single visit.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'Does Shea Homes being a privately held builder affect post-construction cleaning expectations?',
    a: `Shea Homes buyers frequently choose Shea for its long-term quality focus as a privately held company. That same attention to detail extends to move-in preparation. Construction residue is present in every new build regardless of the builder, but buyers with high move-in standards benefit most from a post-construction clean that goes beyond the cosmetic builder clean. The walkthrough confirms the actual scope before any work begins.`,
  },
  {
    q: 'What Las Vegas Valley areas does Final Touch serve for Shea Homes post-construction cleaning?',
    a: `Final Touch serves post-construction cleanup across ${SITE.serviceArea.county}, Nevada, including Las Vegas, Henderson, and North Las Vegas. Shea Homes builds in Summerlin and Henderson communities throughout the Las Vegas Valley. Call ${SITE.phone.display} to confirm coverage for your specific community and address.`,

            . Shea Homes is a privately held builder with Active Lifestyle communities
            for buyers 55 and better. After a builder handoff, every surface holds
            construction residue that standard cleaning cannot address. We scope the
            clean against the actual site before quoting.

            <p>
              Most builders complete a cosmetic clean before the final walkthrough: surface
              wipe-downs, a vacuum pass on floors, and glass cleaned in common areas. This prepares
              the home for the walk without addressing construction residue at the detail level.
              Shea Homes follows the same handoff practice across its communities, and the residue
              left behind is consistent with any new residential build regardless of the community
              type or price tier.
            </p>
            <p>
              What remains after a builder clean is predictable. Drywall dust is ultrafine and
              airborne during construction; it settles into HVAC registers, inside cabinet interiors,
              on top of door frames, and on every horizontal surface. Adhesive and caulk residue
              collect around tile edges, fixtures, and trim. Window film is applied during
              construction to protect glass and must be removed before occupancy. Fine grit from
              cutting and sanding settles on floors and baseboards throughout the home.
            </p>
            <p>
              A professional post-construction clean addresses this layer of residue that a cosmetic
              builder clean is not scoped to cover. The scope is confirmed on-site before the clean
              begins so nothing is assumed.
